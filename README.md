# Generic Gaem

## Brief Details

This game is a open source game which is supposed to be a comedical homeage to [Generic Roleplay Gaem](https://www.roblox.com/games/4598019433/generic-roleplay-gaem) by AznDibs.

Within this game you will be able to perform basic jobs and rise the ranks on a server to hopefully/eventually become a corrupt leader.

And for some reason I am making the barbarians monkeys, because I like monkeys.
